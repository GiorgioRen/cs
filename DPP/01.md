EI: explicit identifiers (name, surname, CF)
allow to directly identify user
QI: quasi identifiers (CAP, age)
allow to indirectly identify the user if combined with external knowledge
SD: sensitive data (income, blood type)
NSD: non sensitive data

Privacy gain: what an adversary can obtain about SD

referential integrity

tokenization:
- loss of semantic
- one way & two way

non perturbative: anonymize mantiene la semantica

$k = f(P_R, U_R, C_R, G_L, C)$
- $P_R$: privacy requirement of data owner (seller of data)
- $U_R$: utility requirement of users of anonymized data (buyer of data)
- $C_R$: compliance requirement of privacy of data (government)
- $G_L$: generalization level
- $C$: constraints
