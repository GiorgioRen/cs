# Objectives
> Collect data about our world, find a model that fits and try to better understand reality

**Overfitting**:
data coming from a second degree function (+ some error) but fitted with a tenth degree function.  Functions fits very well the training set but does poorly on other new data.

**Underfitting**:
data coming from a third degree function, but given the errors we interpret it as a linear function.  Again, our function fits the training set but is unable to fit the real data coming in.
