# ADD Method
> methodology to create software architectures that takes into account the quality attributes of the software.

## Goals
- support design activities **in practice**
- work with many development processes
- quality attributes as process drivers
- address explicitly architecture evaluation and documentation
- provide step by step guidance
- iterative process
- support massive reuse of design concepts

- architecture design performed in a series of **rounds**
	- good fit for iterative development processes
- each round is a series of design iterations
- each iteration is broken down into a series of steps
	- review inputs
	- iterate
- each round should be small enough that the requirements don't change
