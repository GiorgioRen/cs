# Design

**Design**: we have a problem, we design a solution
**Implementation**: take design and build the solution (multiple solutions are possible)

<blockquote>
Input of the design are the <b>requirements</b>
<details>
 	<summary>Functional vs Non-functional requirements</summary>
		functional requirements: website calculates the CodiceFiscale<br>
		non-functional requirements: website should load in max 1 second
</details>
Output of design is the <b>model</b> of system/solution
</blockquote>


## Why?
- estimate and plan the solution (cost & time)
- save time and money on error fixing
	- errors become more expensive the more we're in the final product
	- design can be tested beforehand for conceptual errors (early stage fix)
- **better communication** between devs, stakeholders, new team members...
- **architecture** and **modularity** is key for solution, breakdown the problem in sub-problems and reuse

## When?
Depends on the development process used

## How?
Do not keep information inside people. People and teams change, information is lost.
We need a method to avoid blank canvas panic and to get predictable development time, costs, quality...
Use design pattern and reuse frameworks, libraries

> âš  If you know only some design patterns, you will only use those even if they are not the best solution.
